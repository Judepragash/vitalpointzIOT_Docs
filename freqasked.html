<p>Spinning a IoT core/core-lite in Digitalocean Cloud: Go to the Marketplace of Digitalocean, find Vitalpointz IoT Core/Core-lite and proceed with creation of a droplet with specifications given below</p>
<p>Droplet: Standard</p>
<p>Min Spec: IoT Core-lite &ndash; 2 Core CPU, 4GB RAM, IoT Core &ndash; 4 Core CPU, 8GB RAM</p>
<p>Optionally: Select the Private networking and monitoring</p>
<p>Rest can be selected based on preferences of user.</p>
<p>Refer this <a href="https://judepragash.github.io/vitalpointzIOT_Docs/">Getting Started Document</a> for steps.</p>
<p><em>First time login and initial config wizard</em>: Once the droplet is available, login to it through SSH. For the first time login the SSH will run into an initial config wizard with questions appearing sequentially. In the end of the wizard, you&rsquo;ll get the URL to access the platform and login credential mailed to your mailbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Onboarding IoT device</em>: To use Vitalpointz IoT agent (VESPa), visit to the Github project of Vitalpointz IoT and download what is relevant to your device. Get one of the supported device for the agent or just get the node-red sketch to simulate few in your computer. Create equal no of devices you want to onboard or simulate in the platform. Take a note of login key or auth token generated and burn them into the devices/simulation program. Start the devices/simulation and voila!. You&rsquo;ll see the message received at the platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Visualising messages, routing &amp; processing</em>: Each device onboarded to the IoT Platform is assigned with a dedicated topic. Messages published to that specific topic and subsequent subtopics can be seen by selecting the topics in the message logger. Messages from multiple devices can be aggregated to node-red, in-cloud apps or other external message subscriber.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Q. Why message forwarding &amp; routing needed? How is it done?</h3>
<p>Most sensor and devices data need to be aggregated &amp; forwarded to applications and other subscribers. Routing takes care of the simplified forwarding management in the cloud. The routing rules are manged by rules engine in the cloud</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Q. What are the things can be done with rules engine?</h3>
<p>In addition to forwarding rule management, rules engine handles events &amp; actions. Rules engine can be configured to take an action like redirection, notification &amp; forwarding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
