<h3>Q. I have misconfigured my Org Name/email/some other info? What can I do to correct it?</h3>
<p>When you spin up a droplet with vitalpointz IOT Core/Core Lite, you will be asked to enter the details such as org name and email id. The instance is created with the name you have provided. There is no way you can edit these basic info. Please destroy the droplet and recreate afresh.</p>
<h3><br />Q. I am unable to login to IOT Core/Core Lite web portal. What to do?</h3>
<p>Try clicking on Forgot Password Link to retrieve your password. If your web UI shows errors even if you provide right login credentials, click &lsquo;Trouble Logging in?&rsquo; link.
