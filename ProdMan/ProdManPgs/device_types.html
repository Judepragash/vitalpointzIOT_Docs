<h3><strong>vitalpointz Device Types </strong></h3>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>Vitalpointz IoT Core/Core Lite supports three kinds of devices. They are</p>
<ul>
<li>Fog Node</li>
<li>IoT Device</li>
<li>Virtual Device</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Fog Node</em>: Fog Node is typically a server or communication gateway such as wifi access point with compute resource. Fog Nodes run portion of cloud platform functions such as MQTT broker service etc. It can provide connectivity service to Devices connecting to it. Fog Nodes act as client to Cloud Platform and Server for devices under it. Fog Nodes run some of the cloud platform microservices. Device Authentication service is kept with Cloud Platform for security reasons. In other words, irrespective of whether the devices are under a Fog Node OR directly connected to Cloud Platform, they are authenticated at the Cloud level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vitalpointz provides Operating System based on OpenWRT for Whitebox wifi access points and virtual box image.</p>
<p><em>IoT Device</em>: IoT devices are the ones that read data from sensor and transmit them to external server such as MQTT Broker or REST Server. IoT Device can be &lsquo;parented&rsquo; to Cloud directly or to the Fog Node. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Virtual Device: In simplest form, virtual device are REST clients that can receive data from third party webservices and inject them as messages into IoT Core/Core Lite. Then the IoT business logic can combine/corelate with sensor data to implement powerful business logics.</p>
